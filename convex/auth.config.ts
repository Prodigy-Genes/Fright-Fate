// This configuration is used to set up authentication for Convex.
// It specifies the providers for authentication, including the domain and application ID.
// The `domain` is typically the URL of your Convex site, and the `applicationID` is a unique identifier for your Convex application.
// This configuration is essential for enabling user authentication and managing user sessions within your Convex application.
// Make sure to replace `process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL` with your actual Convex site URL if you're not using environment variables.
// The `applicationID` should also be set to a unique value that identifies your Convex application.
// This setup allows Convex to handle user authentication securely and efficiently, enabling features like user sessions, role management, and access control.
// Ensure that your Convex site is properly configured to use this authentication setup, and that your environment variables are correctly set up in your deployment environment.
// This configuration is typically used in conjunction with Convex's server-side code to manage user sessions and access control.
// It is important to keep this configuration secure and not expose sensitive information in your source code.
// If you're using version control, consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management solution to manage sensitive data like your Convex site URL and application ID.
// This will help you maintain security and flexibility in your Convex application development and deployment process.
// If you need to add more providers or customize the authentication flow, refer to the Convex documentation for more details on how to extend and configure authentication providers.
// You can also implement custom authentication logic by creating additional functions or methods that interact with this configuration.
// This allows you to tailor the authentication experience to your application's specific needs, such as integrating with third-party identity providers or implementing custom user roles and permissions.
// Always test your authentication setup thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and provides a secure user experience.
// Regularly review and update your authentication configuration to keep up with best practices and security standards in web application development.
// This will help you maintain a robust and secure authentication system for your Convex application, ensuring that user data is protected and access control is enforced effectively.
// Additionally, consider implementing logging and monitoring for your authentication system to track user activity and detect any potential security issues. This can help you
